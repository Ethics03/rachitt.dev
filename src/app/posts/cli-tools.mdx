We use **CLI-Tools** almost every day as developers, from git to docker.

These CLI-Tools are not just reliable but also efficient and user-friendly.

What is a CLI-Tool?

***A CLI-tool is a piece of software that lets you interact with your operating system using text-based commands.***

Some of the examples are : <br/>
	- **1. git**
	- **2. docker**
    - **3. npm**
    - **4. btop**
    - **5. FFmpeg**

***But why really are they so powerful?***


- IDEOLOGY BEHIND CLI-Tools<br/>
	- **Simplicity**
	- **Efficiency**
	- **Speed**
	- **Portability**


Whether it’s from checking the tasks running on your operating system using **btop** or using the most famous example of CLI-Tool like **git**, CLI-tools are easy to use and really fast.


*Now why or when do we really need a CLI-Tool?*

Well, from a general perspective considering a large population of users of any operating system the general consensus is —

    ***USE OF CLI IS A FUNDAMENTAL UX ISSUE***

Well that is ***TRUE***.

For basic tasks like **file exploring**, **managing** tasks making **disk partitions** etc. You really don’t need a CLI-Tool unless you messed up your OS install like me and really need it. Regardless for general users CLI-Tools are not preferred for day-to-day tasks or even some development tasks.


***So who really needs CLI-Tools?***
